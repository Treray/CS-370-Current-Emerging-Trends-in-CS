# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I used a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an intelligent pirate agent to navigate through a maze to find the treasure. I was provided with a basic game environment, maze structure, and some existing movement routines. I designed the reinforcement learning model, deep Q-network, experience replay mechanism, and epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration and exploitation, though. I also used the training loop, improved the learning process of the agent, and tested its performance in terms of performance metrics like win rates and loss reduction.


How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

Computer science is focuses on problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and computation optimization. The project demonstrates basic principles in artificial intelligence, more precisely machine learning, an emerging subfield in modern computing. Deep Q-learning has practical applications in robotics, game AI, and decision-making systems, showing how reinforcement learning models can be applied to real-world problems.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethics in AI and software development are required to deliver fairness, privacy, and long-term usability. As a computer scientist, I am ethically bound to develop solutions that are unbiased, secure, and transparent. AI models should be trained on diverse datasets so that they remain non-discriminatory, and user data must be processed with strong privacy controls. Decision transparency is also important, allowing users to understand and have faith in the technology they interact with. Next, writing maintainable code and documentation allows software to work and evolve over time and to benefit organizations and users. Having these ethical responsibilities as the utmost priority helps to create innovative and accountable technology.
