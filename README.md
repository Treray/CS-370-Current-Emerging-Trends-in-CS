# CS-370-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

In this project, I used a deep Q-learning algorithm to train an intelligent pirate agent to navigate through a maze to find the treasure. I was provided with a basic game environment, maze structure, and some existing movement routines. I designed the reinforcement learning model, deep Q-network, experience replay mechanism, and epsilon-greedy strategy for exploration and exploitation, though. I also used the training loop, improved the learning process of the agent, and tested its performance in terms of performance metrics like win rates and loss reduction.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists create and improve technology by designing better algorithms, software, and systems. They find creative solutions to tough problems in fields like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, data science, and software engineering. Their work can lead to important breakthroughs in healthcare, finance, communication, and entertainment. This is important because it drives innovation, increases efficiency, and makes life easier. By developing secure and ethical computing solutions, computer scientists help build a more connected, automated, and information-driven world where technology benefits everyone.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

As a computer scientist, I break problems into smaller parts to make them easier to handle. I analyze possible solutions and refine my approach step by step. For this project, I needed to learn about reinforcement learning, pick the best strategies to improve performance, and fix errors that came up during the learning process. Debugging and improving how the agent makes decisions showed me how important it is to test and evaluate different model setups.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

Ethics in AI and software development are required to deliver fairness, privacy, and long-term usability. As a computer scientist, I am ethically bound to develop solutions that are unbiased, secure, and transparent. AI models should be trained on diverse datasets so that they remain non-discriminatory, and user data must be processed with strong privacy controls. Decision transparency is also important, allowing users to understand and have faith in the technology they interact with. Next, writing maintainable code and documentation allows software to work and evolve over time and to benefit organizations and users. Having these ethical responsibilities as the utmost priority helps to create innovative and accountable technology.
